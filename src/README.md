# Implementation
This node.js project is a small demo of how to implement many of the functional requirements present in everyday APIs we use.

It has been developed using

* [express](https://github.com/expressjs/expressjs.com) as the main app server.
* [apollo-server-express](https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-server), as an express middleware.
* [mongoose](https://github.com/Automattic/mongoose), to model and access MongoDB objects.

To install the dependencies, run `npm install`. Then configure your MongoDB in `nodemon.json`. Finally, to run the project, exec `npm start`.
